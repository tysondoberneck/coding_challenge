### Hey Matt!
Im excited to show you my solutions for the Senior Data Engineer Coding Challenge

- The input that I attached to Rippling is the same as what is found in the seeds folder under `obie_coding_challenge\seeds\policy_data.csv`
- The output code is attached in Rippling as well, but I can provide a more in depth walk through in Snowflake if needed.
- The SQL solution can be found in the models folder here: `obie_coding_challenge\models`
- The Python solution can be found here: `obie_coding_challenge\coding_challenge_python.py`

Thanks in advance! I am excited for your review and am eager for your feedback ðŸ˜Š
